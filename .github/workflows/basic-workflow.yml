# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions.
# It listens for Push actions on main and dev branches and whenever push action happens, builds  a
# docker image from Dockerfile

name: Docker Image CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "dev" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
